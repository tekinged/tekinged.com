            There are a great many commonly used affixes in the Palauan language. These can be found 
            listed <a href=/show_words.php?lookup=affix>here</a> and many are described in great detail 
            in the <a href=/books/books.php?filter=grammar>Palauan grammar books</a>.

          <p>
            <h2>The i- prefix</h2>
            While not documented in any of the <a href=/books/books.php?filter=grammar>Palauan grammar books</a>
            book, an 'i-' may be prefixed to certain words (usually demonstrative pronouns) to provide emphasis, and
            these emphasized words are frequently used in Palauan.  For example, <em>tia</em> is changed
            to <em>itia</em> to provide emphasis (i.e. this particular thing).  

            <p><p>
            This is commonly heard in
            songs in the phrase <em>itia el renguk</em> (this heart of mine) (e.g. <em><a href=http://www.hellaholler.com/ouchacha/mp3/Adidil%20eng%20Kebesengei%20-%20Oketang.mp3>Adidil e ng
            Kebesengei</em></a>).  

            <p>
            More examples can be found in five song books that contained the song 
            <a href=http://www.hellaholler.com/ouchacha/mp3/07-Doki%20Doki%20Sel%20Tal.mp3><em>Doki Doki</em></a> 
            which wrote the first person-emphatic pronoun as <em>yak</em> (more
            correctly spelled as <em>iak</em>,  
            apparently to emphasize that <em>I remained</em>: 
            <br><center><em>e iak kililei mak bai dilu klmesmechek</em>.</center>

            <p><p>
            Yoichi Rengiil, in his song 
            <a href=https://hellaholler.com/ouchacha/mp3/058-48.mp3><em>Oh! Somebody Me Keleng Saingo</em></a>, 
            uses the phrase <em>kaui a uchul e ak morolung</em> (you are the reason that I am leaving).

            <p>
            Additionally, an '-i' is often found appended to words such as <em>aika</em>
            to make <em>aikai</em>.  A very common phrase in Palauan songs is <em>aikaikid a
            lengelek er kau</em> (these are my tears for you).  
            Appending
            the emphasizing '-i' is also demonstrated in the phrase <em>tilechai a renguk el
            diobengkem</em> (that is my heart that just accompanies you) from the song 
            <a href=http://www.hellaholler.com/ouchacha/mp3/071.mp3><em>Dider a Sechou</em></a>.

            <p>
            In the previous examples where the emphasizing 'i' is added at the
            end of the word, it is probably the case that the correct grammatical construction is that 
            the 'i' should instead be prefixed to the
            connecting word <em>a</em> to form <em>ia</em> to provide emphasis to the word that follows,
            especially when that word is a noun.  For example, Yoichi Rengiil explained 
            that in the line from the song 
            <a href=http://www.hellaholler.com/ouchacha/mp3/071.mp3><em>Dider a Sechou</em></a>.
            that states <em>e ia rebldekek te
            ngar keltang</em> (my ancestors, where are they?) the <em>ia</em> adds emphasis on the
            singerâ€™s ancestors. Yoichi used a similar construction in <em>Oh! Somebody</em> with the
            line <em>e ia otoko a di mlo ikrii</em> (and then the man just turned his back on her).
