  <b>sis el ulaol</b> <i>n.</i> <ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Tradional ceremony following a death in which a sis (the plant, with its leaves), is placed on the middle of the floor.  Spirits are called to find out the cause of death. It was practiced long time ago, but is no longer a practice today.  It  is performed four days after burying a person. The sis plant is placed on the middle of the floor where the deceased was laid during the funeral. Then a person who knows how to conduct the ceremony would call on the spirits. When the spirits are ready, each person circling the sis would say something that could have caused the death. When a person actually mentions the actual cause of death, the sis would elevate on its own and shake (or dance). If the cause of death was the doing of a spirit, then the families are made aware so they can do things to appeal to or appease the spirit so that further death to the family by the spirit is stopped. That is basically the only reason for this practice (to see if spirits are involved in the cause of death so the family can act to stop it from further happening to their members).  The actual ceremony is not practiced nowadays, but some clans and families continue to prepare small feasts on that fourth day after the funeral then the people (especially "mechas") who were part of the "mengiung" can now go back home. Some still call this day "sis el ulaol" but some intentionally ignore to call it that because it is believed the actual "sis el ulaol ceremony" involves invoking evil spirits that makes the sis float and dance when the right cause of death is mentioned.</li></ul><br>From root word <b>sis</b> <i>n.</i> <ul style="list-style: none;"><li>ceremony after death.</li><li><i>sis a ongedei el kebesengil a omelakl er a mlad el chad; olturek er a sis el osiik a uchul a secher me a kodall.</i></li></ul><br><br>Snippet provided by <a href=http://tekinged.com>tekinged.com</a>; see full site for more detailed listings.<br></body></html>
